	<h2>About sublime :</h2>
	<p >lorem60 aasudhaudohweuohfinter plugins are separate Sublime Text 3 plugins that are hosted in separate repositories. There are a number of officially supported linter plugins in the SublimeLinter organization. There are third party linters available as well.

Again, I strongly recommend that you use Package Control to locate and install linter plugins. To install linter plugins in Package Control, do the following:

Open the Command Palette (cmd+shift+p on Mac OS X, ctrl+shift+p on Linux/Windows).
Type install
When the list of available packages appears, type sublimelinter-. You will see a list of plugins whose names begin with “SublimeLinter-”. Click on the plugin you wish to install.
After a few seconds the plugin will be installed and loaded. You will then see an install message with instructions on what you should do to complete the installation.
After reading the instructions, restart Sublime Text 3.</p>
